# Week 3: Data Structures – Linked List Fundamentals

## 📅 Day 5 – Linked List Implementation & Operations  
**Date:** 02-Jan-2026

Focused on understanding Linked List fundamentals by implementing node-based structures and performing common linked list operations using clean and modular Java code.

### What I practiced today:
- Creating nodes and linking them together
- Traversing linked lists
- Inserting nodes at different positions
- Deleting and searching elements in a linked list

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Designed reusable and focused methods
- Avoided hard-coded values
- Maintained proper indentation and readability
- Used meaningful variable and method names

### Work Done:
- Implemented multiple linked list programs
- Practiced core linked list operations
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub

## 📅 Day 6 – Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing Functions  
**Date:** 03-Jan-2026

Worked on core data structures by implementing Stack, Queue, and HashMap concepts and understanding how hashing supports efficient data storage.

### What I practiced today:
- Stack operations using LIFO principle
- Queue operations using FIFO principle
- Implementing stacks and queues
- Working with HashMap key-value pairs
- Understanding hashing and collision handling

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Wrote small and reusable methods
- Used clear and descriptive naming conventions
- Maintained clean formatting and structure
- Organized logic for maintainability

### Work Done:
- Completed Stack, Queue, and HashMap practice programs
- Tested and verified all implementations
- Committed and pushed code to GitHub

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
Built strong fundamentals in Stack, Queue, and HashMap data structures and understood how hashing improves performance in Java applications.
