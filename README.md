# Week 2: Java Strings and oops concepts

## 📅 Day 4 – Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals  
**Date:** 26-Dec-2025

Dedicated this day to reinforcing Object-Oriented Programming basics by practically working with Java classes and objects while adhering to clean and professional coding practices.

### What I practiced today:
- **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:**
  - Learning the fundamentals of classes and objects
  - Creating objects and accessing their members
  - Working with constructors for object creation
  - Invoking methods through object references
- **Java Methods:**
  - Writing and invoking methods
  - Passing parameters and handling return values
  - Implementing method overloading
- **Java Class Design:**
  - Designing well-structured and meaningful classes
  - Creating and managing multiple objects from a single class

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Designed classes with clearly defined responsibilities.
- Followed standard naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes.
- Moved logic out of the `main()` method into reusable methods.
- Reduced code repetition by creating reusable logic blocks.

### Work Done:
- Developed multiple Java programs demonstrating OOPS concepts.
- Verified program behavior using different object instances.
- Committed and pushed all OOPS-related programs to GitHub.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
Strengthened understanding of Java OOPS by applying classes, objects, constructors, and methods to build clean, modular, and reusable programs.
