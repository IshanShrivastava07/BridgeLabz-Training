# Week 3: Data Structures – Linked List Fundamentals

## 📅 Day 5 – Linked List Implementation & Operations  
**Date:** 02-Jan-2026

Focused on understanding Linked List fundamentals by implementing node-based structures and performing common linked list operations using clean and modular Java code.

### What I practiced today:
- Creating nodes and linking them together
- Traversing linked lists
- Inserting nodes at different positions
- Deleting and searching elements in a linked list

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Designed reusable and focused methods
- Avoided hard-coded values
- Maintained proper indentation and readability
- Used meaningful variable and method names

### Work Done:
- Implemented multiple linked list programs
- Practiced core linked list operations
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub
