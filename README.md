# Week 2: Java Strings and oops concepts

## 📅 Day 4 – Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals  
**Date:** 26-Dec-2025

Dedicated this day to reinforcing Object-Oriented Programming basics by practically working with Java classes and objects while adhering to clean and professional coding practices.

### What I practiced today:
- **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:**
  - Learning the fundamentals of classes and objects
  - Creating objects and accessing their members
  - Working with constructors for object creation
  - Invoking methods through object references
- **Java Methods:**
  - Writing and invoking methods
  - Passing parameters and handling return values
  - Implementing method overloading
- **Java Class Design:**
  - Designing well-structured and meaningful classes
  - Creating and managing multiple objects from a single class

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Designed classes with clearly defined responsibilities.
- Followed standard naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes.
- Moved logic out of the `main()` method into reusable methods.
- Reduced code repetition by creating reusable logic blocks.

### Work Done:
- Developed multiple Java programs demonstrating OOPS concepts.
- Verified program behavior using different object instances.
- Committed and pushed all OOPS-related programs to GitHub.

## 📅 Day 5 – Java Constructors, Instance vs Class Variables  
**Date:** 27-Dec-2025

Focused on mastering Java constructors and understanding the distinction between instance and class variables by exploring object initialization and memory behavior.

### What I practiced today:
- **Java Constructors:**
  - Understanding the role of constructors
  - Working with default and parameterized constructors
  - Implementing constructor overloading
  - Using the `this` keyword effectively
- **Instance vs Class Variables:**
  - Memory allocation for instance variables
  - Shared behavior of static (class-level) variables
  - Comparing instance and static members
- **Object Initialization:**
  - Creating objects using constructors
  - Accessing variables and methods through object references

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Used variables for constants, inputs, and outputs.
- Implemented logic using methods rather than writing everything in `main()`.
- Followed proper naming standards for clarity.
- Used descriptive program and class names.

### Work Done:
- Completed programs related to constructors and variable scope.
- Added all programs to submission documentation.
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
Developed a clear understanding of constructor behavior and memory differences between instance and static variables, improving object-oriented class design.

# Week 3: Java Keywords & Object Handling

## 📅 Day 1 – this, static, final Keywords & instanceof Operator  
**Date:** 29-Dec-2025

Focused on understanding important Java keywords and object handling mechanisms by implementing programs using `this`, `static`, `final`, and `instanceof`.

### What I practiced today:
- **Java Keywords:**
  - Use cases of the `this` keyword
  - Static variables and methods
  - Final variables, methods, and classes
- **Object Handling:**
  - Runtime type checking using the `instanceof` operator

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Stored all fixed values, inputs, and outputs using variables.
- Encapsulated logic within methods for better readability.
- Followed consistent naming conventions.
- Used meaningful and descriptive class names.

### Work Done:
- Implemented programs demonstrating keyword usage.
- Updated submission documents with solutions.
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub.

## 📅 Day 2 – Object Modeling & Class Diagram  
**Date:** 30-Dec-2025

Focused on object modeling by designing real-world Java applications and understanding class structure, relationships, and object-oriented design principles.

### What I practiced today:
- **Object Modeling Concepts:**
  - Understanding the basics of object modeling
  - Designing clear class structures
  - Learning class diagrams and object relationships

### Best Programming Practices Followed:
- Used clear and meaningful variable and method names.
- Maintained clean code formatting and indentation.
- Designed modular and readable code blocks.
- Avoided unnecessary hard-coded values.

### Work Done:
- Completed object modeling and class diagram practice programs.
- Added all programs to submission documentation.
- Tested, committed, and pushed all programs to GitHub.
